# Mini-Meltdown
![GitHub Logo](/sprites/git/unknown.png)
A mod for those who hate the balance of the lategame.
This mod adds a single turret, the mini meltdown. The mini meltdown behaves exactly like a regular meltdown, except for one small change; it fits in a 1x1 tile. Same damage, range, cost, and power consumption, but in a smaller package. I advise turning off sound but placing too many.
